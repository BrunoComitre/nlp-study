# Libraries-for-NLP-Study-Python



### **Introduction:**



This repository was created for the study and learning of Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries and learning tools.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the ways to have a number of applications such as chatbots, machine translation, among others, aimed at text exploration.

The most commonly used libraries for word processing are listed below:



Important Libraries for NLP programming in Python:
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Machine learning in Python
- [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/): The complete toolkit for all NLP techniques.
- [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) – Easy to use NL p tools API, built on top of NLTK and Pattern.
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) – Free Open-Source library for NLP in Python
- [Pattern](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pages/pattern) – Pattern is a web mining module for the Python programming language.
- [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) – Topic Modelling for Humans
- [Stanford Core NLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) – NLP services and packages by Stanford NLP Group.
- [ULMFit](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html) - An effective transfer learning method that can be applied to any task in NLP.
- [SentilexPT](xldb.fc.ul.pt/wiki/SentiLex-PT01) - Lexicons for Portuguese Text Analysis.
